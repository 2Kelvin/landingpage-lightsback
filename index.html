            <p>
                Living in an area experiencing regular power outages each week, I found that part of the issue to fix
                the power anomaly was due to people not having the right channel to contact the power company. This
                prolonged the power outage period.
            </p>
            <p>That's when I had an idea to make an application where anyone with access to a phone, computer or laptop
                could quickly login in, provide details about the power issue and wait for the much needed help from the
                power company.
            </p>
            <p>This web application does exactly that, it's an easy and accessible platform to reach out
                for help from the power company. And it only takes a couple of minutes to do this by just sending an
                email. It also has other contacts to reach the power company saving clients' time looking for those
                contacts on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took me 2 weeks to complete this project as a portfolio project for my software engineering course at
                ALX Africa.
