                <p>
                    Living in an area experiencing regular power outages each week, I found that part of the issue was
                    due to people not having the right channel to contact the power company. This
                    prolonged the power outage period.
                </p>
                <p>That's when I had an idea to make an application where anyone with access to a phone, computer or
                    laptop could quickly login in, provide details about the power issue and wait for the much needed
                    help from the power company.
                </p>
                <p>This web application does exactly that, it's an easy and accessible platform to reach out
                    for help from the power company. And it only takes a couple of minutes to do this by just sending an
                    email. It also has other contacts to reach the power company saving time looking for those
                    contacts on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me 2 weeks to complete this project as a portfolio project for my software engineering
                    course at <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX Africa</a>.
